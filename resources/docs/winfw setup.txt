Rule: BLOCK EVERYTHING AND REPORT
=================================

    1) Set firewall to block by default
        wf.msc
            Right‑click the top node and choose Properties.
            For Domain, Private, and Public set Inbound connections = Block and Outbound connections = Block.

    2) Enable firewall logging
        wf.msc
            right‑click the top node → Properties → Logging for each profile.
            Set dropped packet logging on and increase log size

    3) Create audit events (so Event Viewer gets events on block)
        secpol.msc
            Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > System Audit Policies > Object Access > Filtering Platform Packet Drop and Filtering Platform Connection -> Audit on Failure
            
    4) Create alerts
        Event Viewer
            Windows Logs -> Security
            Look for a blocked packet event (probably event ID 5152 or 5157)
            Right click -> attach task to event (events will be in Task Scheduler > Event Viewer Tasks)
                Will need to spawn a task from event viewer for each event-id
                Start a program: powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Users\User\scripts\winevent-alerter.ps1"
                If task is already running: queue instance



            Defs:
                Event ID 5152 indicates the Windows Filtering Platform blocked an individual network packet
                Event ID 5157 indicates the Windows Filtering Platform blocked a network connection attempt (a higher‑level connection event vs a single packet)
